            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THis is life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Whom did the Father ſend? Did he not ſend the Son of his Love? From whence did he ſend him? Did he not ſend him out of his own Boſom? Whither did he ſend him? Did he not ſend him into the World to take upon him a Body, and glorifie the Name of the Father, doing his Will therein? He laid down his Glory, ſtripping himſelf of the form of God, and appearing in habit as a man, in their Raiment, with their Garment upon him; in which, as a Servant, the Seed, (the Heir of all) ſerved the Father. And now his work being as good as done, he looks back at the Glory which he had laid down for the Fathers ſake, looking up to the Father for the reſtoring of it to him again. <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was,</hi> John <hi>17.4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having ſought and travelled (from my Childhood) after the true knowledge of God, and of his Chriſt; and having been ſatisfied with nothing elſe that ever I could meet with, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length (through the tender mercy of the Lord, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Spirit) met with this, and been ſatisfied therewith, finding it to be the eternal Life, the true Food, the living Power, the pure Reſt, the Joy and Salvation of the Soul; I cannot but teſtifie it to thoſe that lay out their Money for that which is not Bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</p>
            <p>We (ſome of us at leaſt) laid out as much of our money as others who now deſpiſe us have done, and as much of our labour; And (I may ſpeak it in the fear of the Lord, and in true ſence, without boaſting) ſome of us had as much of that which they feed on, &amp; call bread, as they have now. Yet when the Lord brought us to the true Ballance, we found it not to be bread, nor able to give
<pb facs="tcp:96896:3"/>
the Soul true ſatisfaction. The bread was not that which we then called bread, but that which we overlooked, and wiſt not what it was. But the eternal Life, which was hid with the Father, &amp; is manifeſted in the Son, and made known to the Soul, (as the Son is manifeſted to it, and revealed in it) that is bread indeed, that is meat which periſheth not, but will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure when all litteral and outward knowledge of God and Chriſt fails and will fall ſhort of ſatisfying that hunger of the Soul, which is after the ſubſtance it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now to draw mens minds to a ſence of Truth, to a ſence of that which is the thing, that they might know the Bread indeed, that they might know the living Waters, come to them and drink thereof, and find Chriſt in them a Well of Water ſpringing up to eternal Life; therefore was it in my heart to give forth this Queſtion, and the enſuing Queries, which he that rightly anſwers muſt know the thing; and he that doth not know the thing, by his inability to anſwer may find that he doth not, and ſo may wait upon God that he may receive the knowledge of it, and come to it, for the eternal Life which it freely giveth.</p>
            <p>The Jews were puzled with a literal knowledge of the Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and about the Meſſiah to come, according to their underſtanding of the Propheſies concerning him, and ſo were kept from the true knowledge thereby. Moſt ſorts of thoſe that now profeſs Chriſt, are puzled about a knowledge concerning the outward Body, fleſh and blood of Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they apprehend the Scriptures to ſpeak, and ſo the vail is over their hearts likewiſe, and they cannot ſee the eternal Life and Subſtance, no more than the Jews; but by an outward litteral knowledge are kept back from the thing, as the Jews were. Now the breathing of my heart to the Lord is, to take away the Vail from all hearts that ſincerely deſire after Truth, and to open the true Eye in them, that they may ſee the deſire and beloved of their Souls, and may be led by him into the true travel, out of ſelf, towards the Kingdom, yea into the very Land of the living, where the food of Life is fed upon, where the living Springs flow, where are Vineyards which we planted not, and dwelling places which we built not, where the fruit of the Vine of Gods planting (the Wine of the Kingdom) is drunk of, even new in the Kingdom, with the Father and Son in the Spirit, who are one and all there.</p>
            <p>The Lord give a ſence and underſtanding, that the ear of the Needy, the afflicted in Spirit, the Mourners, the Captives, the bowed down may hear, and may be drawn to touch that which hath the virtue in it, and which effectually redeemeth (thoſe that wait upon it) from all that bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down and oppreſſeth.</p>

                  <hi>A Queſtion to the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity;</hi> Whether they have the true, living, powerful, ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt, or no?</head>
               <p>THE Queſtion is not, Whether they know what is ſaid of him in the Scriptures; but whether they know it <hi>ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, truly, livingly, powerfully?</hi> Yea, they may know what is ſaid of him, and yet not know him of whom thoſe things are ſaid. As it was with the Scribes and Phariſees; they knew what was ſaid of Chriſt in the Law and Prophets; but they knew not him himſelf, when he appeared in that body of Fleſh. So men may now know what the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts have ſaid concerning his appearance in a body of Fleſh, (concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Birth, Circumciſion, Baptiſm, Preaching, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and yet not know him, of whom theſe things are ſaid. Yea, they may know what is ſaid concerning the Word which was from the beginning, and yet not know the Word, the Power, the Life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Since the prevailing of the Apoſtles Teſtimony, the way of the Enemy hath not been directly to deny Chriſt, but to bring men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a knowledge of Chriſt, as ſaves not. And as the Enemy did own Chriſt, when he appeared in that body of Fleſh, ſaying, <hi>I know thee who thou art, the holy One of God:</hi> So he hath found it for his advantage, almoſt ever ſince, to own that appearance of his. So that this he doth not oppoſe, nor mens knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Scriptures ſo, as to confirm them in this. But the Saving knowledge, the True knowledge, the Living knowledge, the powerful knowledge of Truth, that he alwayes oppoſeth; for that alone overturns and deſtroys his Kingdom in man, and brings man from out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Now there is a vaſt difference between knowing the Relations concerning a thing, and knowing the thing related of. And there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96896:4"/>
is alſo a great deal of difference between believing the Relations concerning a thing, and believing in the thing which is related of.</p>
               <p>Spiritual things cannot be ſavingly known, but in union with them, in the receiving of them. A man can never really know the Spirit of God, by all that can be ſaid concerning it, but he muſt firſt feel ſomewhat of it, whereby he may truly know it. So the Peace, the Joy, the Life, the Power, they paſs the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a man can never rightly know them by reading, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending never ſo much concerning them; but by coming out of himſelf, and travelling thither where they are given and made manifeſt, he may come into acquaintance with them. And if the Peace which Chriſt gives, the Joy, the Life, the Power, cannot be thus known by litteral deſcriptions; How can he, who is the Fulneſs of all, the Fountain of them all, the Treaſury of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in whom are hid all the Riches and Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge; how can he be known by outward and litteral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions?</p>
               <p>Now we have travelled through theſe things. We knew former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what ye know now; and we alſo know now, what God hath given us further; and what our former knowledge was, and what our preſent knowledge is. And this is it which gives us ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Our knowledge is in a Principle, wherein we receive our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of knowing, and wherein the Father (from whom the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple came) teacheth us. And this is his way of teaching us, to wit, by making us one with the thing he teacheth. Thus we learn Chriſt, by being born of him, by putting him on. Thus we know his Righteouſneſs, his Life, his Wiſdom, his Power, by receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proportion of them, which giveth an ability to diſcern and acknowledge the fulneſs. And in this we receive the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and know the Seed of the Woman, (which bruiſeth the Serpents head) by receiving the Seed, by feeling its growth in us, and its power over the Enemy. Then we know the thing; likewiſe we know the VVoman that brings forth this Seed after the Spirit, which is the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above; and we know alſo, and ſingly acknowledge the bringing forth of it outwardly after the fleſh. This Seed we know to be the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Seed of <hi>David</hi> after the Fleſh, and the Seed of God after the power of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96896:4"/>
the endleſs life. And we are taught of God to give the due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to each; to the Seed of God in the firſt place, to the Seed of <hi>David</hi> in the ſecond place. There was the Seed that wrought the thing, which Seed was the Life; and the Seed in which he wrought it, which was formed into a Veſſel like ours, but without ſin, in which the pure Lamb appeared in the pure Power of Life, which kept the Veſſel pure: and ſo he (who was to be the firſt Fruits) had the honour above all his Brethren, being anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs above his Fellows.</p>
               <p>But we alſo are born of the ſame Seed. He is formed in us, we are formed of him; we are as well of his fleſh and blood, as he was of ours. And by being thus formed, and feeling him grow up in us, and receiving an underſtanding from him, and in him; thus we come to know him, and to underſtand the words of Scripture concerning him. By feeling and knowing the Lamb in our Veſſels, we know alſo what was the Lamb in his Veſſel.</p>
               <p>Thus we know things in the certainty and demonſtration of Gods Spirit, even in the Light which ſhines from him, and in the Life which he begets; and we ſpeak of things as they are, and as we feel them to be in the true Life, which the Spirit of Chriſt hath begotten in us. And we can truly ſay concerning the Scriptures, that now we believe, not ſo much becauſe of the relation of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, which we have found in them; but becauſe we have ſeen and received the thing which the Scriptures ſpeak of, and find it to be the very thing indeed, the very Chriſt of God, the ſpotleſs One, the living Garment of Righteouſneſs and Salvation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God findeth no fault, and in which the Soul appears without blame before him. And concerning this can we ſpeak words of its Nature, words of its Virtue, words of its Life, Power and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which that which is of the fleſh cannot hear, but that which is born of God naturally owneth and underſtandeth. Why ſo? Becauſe it knoweth the nature of the thing, and receiveth them in the ſavour thereof. Can Life deny Life? Can the Birth of Life deny that which ſprings out of the ſame Womb? No, no. The Children which are born of Wiſdom, do juſtifie Wiſdom in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſproutings forth and appearances; but that which denies it, is a birth after the Letter, a birth after the litteral and outward knowledge of things, a birth of the comprehending Wiſdom; that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96896:5"/>
indeed reproacheth and blaſphemeth the incomprehenſible wiſdom, in its incomprehenſible wayes, and would reſtrain life to what they apprehend, or can comprehend by the Letter concerning it.</p>
               <p>And this may be a great evidence to Profeſſors, that they know not Chriſt indeed, Chriſt in his Nature, Spirit, Life, and Power; becauſe they ſpeak not of him as Perſons who feel the thing, and ſpeak from the preſent ſence of it, and acquaintance with it, but only as perſons that bring forth a Notion they have received into their underſtandings. And yet they fail therein alſo; for they ſpeak not of Chriſt according as the Scriptures hold him forth, compared one with another, but as they have groſly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended concerning him from ſome Scriptures, as the <hi>Jews</hi> outward did. For the Scriptures ſpeak not only of a Body, but alſo of him that appeared in the Body; nor only of bodily fleſh, blood and bones, but alſo of ſuch fleſh and bones, whereof Chriſt and his Church conſiſt. He is Chriſt, (ſay the Scriptures) who is one with the Father, who came from the Father, in whom the Father was, and who was in the Father; ſo ſaid Jeſus of himſelf (lifting up his eyes to Heaven, and praying to the Father for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the Children whom the Father had given him) more then once in that ſeventeenth Chapter of <hi>John.</hi> Yea he is Chriſt, whom a man cannot ſee, but he muſt ſee the Father alſo; and whom, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeeth the Father, ſeeth, who was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was; whom no man could know whence he was, even as no man can know whence the Father is. Chriſt granted the <hi>Jews</hi> that they knew him, and whence he was as to his Body; and yet for all that, he was the Chriſt who was to come, whom no man knew from whence he was. What was that, Chriſt called <hi>me,</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Philip? Haſt thou not known me</hi> Philip? <hi>Haſt thou not ſeen me?</hi> What, doſt thou know me after the fleſh, after the body? Doſt thou take that for me? Have I been ſo long with you, and do ye know me no better then ſo? The body is from below, the body is like one of yours, (only ſanctifyed by the Father, and preſerved without ſin,) but I am the ſame Spirit, Life and Being with the Father. We are one Subſtance, one pure power of Life, and we cannot be divided; but he that ſees one muſt needs ſee both, and he that knows one muſt needs know both. This is the Lamb of God which <hi>John</hi> bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of, which he ſaid was before him, (<hi>John</hi> 1.15.) which the body was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96896:5"/>Now Friends, if ye have this living ſpiritual knowledge, if ye hold it in him that is true; then own and acknowledge it, (as it is expreſſed in the Scriptures, and as God hath now brought it forth in his People) that ye may manifeſt your ſelves to that which is of God, that ye are of him. There is an underſtanding and wiſdom of man, and there is a Witneſs of God, which Witneſs gives true Judgment. Man (at beſt) judgeth but according as things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him from the Scriptures; but the Witneſs judgeth of the things of God in the demonſtration of the Spirit, according as they are felt and known to be in him.</p>
               <p>But if ye have not this knowledge, but have long laid out your money and labour for that which is not bread, nor can yeeld the true ſatisfaction; O come to the waters, and receive that which is given freely, without money and without price. O ſell all for the Pearl, for the knowledge which is of Life, for the knowledge which is Life. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, this is life Eternal to know. And wait to feel the Rock laid as a Foundation in you, even the Seed of God, the Life of Chriſt, the Spirit of Chriſt revealed in you, and your Souls born of it, and built upon it. O that ye could come out of your own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that ye might feel and receive the love of my Heart, and know the travel of my Bowels for you; that ye might be born of the Truth, and know and receive it as it is in Jeſus, and as it is felt in the Spirit, and in its own pure Power.</p>
               <p>Now a little further to remove Scruple; and Prejudices out of the minds of ſuch as ſometimes have been touched with the power of Truth, and have had the Witneſs of God reached to in their hearts; but afterwards the Enemy hath raiſed miſts, and caſt blocks in their way, ſtirring up in them hard thoughts againſt us, as if we denyed what the Scriptures affirm in this thing, and indeed (in effect) that Chriſt which died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſet up a natural Principle within inſtead thereof.</p>
               <p>To remove this out of the minds of the honeſt-hearted, (who in the guidance of God may light on this Paper) I ſhall open my heart nakedly herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do own that the Word of God (the only begotten of the Father) did take up a Body of the fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who was of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Scriptures, and did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96896:6"/>
the Will of the Father therein, in holy obedience unto him both in life and death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he did offer up the fleſh and blood of that Body (though not only ſo, for he poured out his Soul, he poured out his Life) a Sacrifice or Offering for ſin, (do not, O do not ſtumble at it, but rather wait on the Lord to underſtand it, for we ſpeak in this matter what we know) a Sacrifice unto the Father, and in it taſted death for every man; and that it is upon conſideration (and through Gods acceptance of this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for ſin) that the ſins of Believers are pardoned, that God might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus, or who is of the Faith of Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is attributed to that Body, we acknowledge and give to that Body in its place, according as the Scripture attributeth it, which is through and becauſe of that which dwelt and acted in it. But that which ſanctified and kept the Body pure (and made all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in him) was the Life, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of the Spirit. And the ſame thing that kept his Veſſel pure, it is the ſame thing that cleanſeth us. The value which the natural fleſh and blood had, was from that; in its coming from that, in its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that, in its ſuffering through that. Yea, indeed, that hath the virtue, that is it which is of an unchangeable nature, which abideth for ever, which is pure, and maketh pure for ever; and it is impoſſible for a man to touch it, but he muſt feel cleanſing by it. Now this living Virtue and Power, man was ſhut out from by the fall, but through the true knowledge of the death of Chriſt, the way is made open to it again, and man brought to it to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, waſhed, cleanſed, ſanctified, fitted for, and filled with life; ſo that this is it that doth the thing; this is it from whence Chriſt had his own fleſh and blood, (for we are taught both by the Spirit and by the Scriptures to diſtinguiſh between Chriſts own fleſh, and that of ours, which he took up and made his) which fleſh and blood we feed of in the Spirit, which they cannot feed on which ſerve at the outward Tabernacle, nor they neither which know onely the outward body, but they only that feed in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now of this thing we might ſpeak yet more clearly and plainly, could men hear our words. But if we have ſpoken to you earthly things (in Parables and Figures, ſuitable to your underſtanding)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96896:6"/>
and ye believe not; How ſhall ye believe, if we ſpeak to you hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things; if we ſhould tell you plainly of the Father, in whom is all the life of the Son, and all the virtue of Salvation that ever the Son had from him? The Jews were to learn in Types, Figures and Shadows, till Chriſt came. And after Chriſt came, he alſo taught them in Reſemblances and Similitudes of things: and the Apoſtle wrote and ſpake much to perſons, as juſt coming out of that ſtate, in a language ſuited to that ſtate. But he that comes into the thing it ſelf, and is taught there by the Spirit; after he is grown up and made capable, he is taught plainly the nature of the Heavenly things, and the words of the Apoſtles, (concerning the deep things of God) which are myſterious to others, are manifeſt &amp; plain to him. Yea the Lord ſo teacheth him things, as words cannot utter; that is, He ſo knoweth the Peace of God, the Joy of his Spirit, the Life and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and pure pretious way of ſanctifying the heart, the tender Mercy, Faithfulneſs and rich love of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he cannot utter to any man; nay ſo, as he never learned (nor could learn) from words about the thing; but by the ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the thing it ſelf, the Lord (in whom are the depths of life, and who giveth the ſenſe and underſtanding of the deep things of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) opening them in him, and manifeſting them to him. And indeed, this is the right and excellent way of knowledge, to come into the Union, to come into the Thing it ſelf; to learn in the Union, to ſee and know in the Thing. This is the Way that the Lord teacheth all his Children in the new Covenant, by inward Life, by the pure Light within, by the inward demonſtration of his Spirit, by the Power and Virtue of the Truth it ſelf, which it hath in him that is true. And he that is in the <hi>Son,</hi> hath ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this Life: and he that hath not ſome meaſure of this Life, is not in the <hi>Son;</hi> but in a talk and wiſe knowledge of things after the fleſh, which will periſh, and he with it, who abideth there. For no man can be ſaved, but by coming into the knowledge which is of a pure eternal, living, ſaving Nature. Can an opinion which a man takes up concerning Chriſt from the Scriptures (and caſting himſelf thereupon) ſave him? for it is no more than an Opinion or Judgment unto a man, unleſs he be in the life and power of the thing it ſelf. Then indeed it is Truth to him, Knowledge in him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96896:7"/>
right Knowledge; otherwiſe it is but Knowledge falſly ſo called, Knowledge which will not ſubdue his heart to Truth, nor hath its ſeat there, but in his head, making him wiſe and able there to oppoſe Truth, and ſo bringing him into a ſtate of Condemnation, Wrath and Miſery beyond the Heathen, and making him harder to be wrought upon by the Light and Power of Truth, than the very Heathen. Therefore conſider your wayes, O Profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and do not deſpiſe the hand which is ſtretched forth to you in the love of God, and in the motion and guidance of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> who condeſcends to you exceedingly, that he might reach to his own in you, and ſcatter your Apprehenſions, Imaginations and Conceivings about the meanings of Scriptures (which are as ſo many Chains of Death and Darkneſs upon you) that ye might come to him in whom is Life, and who gives life freely to all that come to him. O obſerve what Barrs were in the way of the Scribes and Phariſees. They would not come to him that they might have life; nay indeed they could not, as they ſtood. There are greater Barrs in your way; yea it is harder for many of you to come to him, than it was for them. My upright deſire to the Lord for you is, That he would remove the ſtumbling-blocks out of your way, that he would batter and knock down the fleſh in you, that he would ſtrip you of al your knowledge of Scriptures according to the fleſh, that ye might be made by him capable of knowing and receiving things according to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and then ye will know how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, honour and make uſe of the Letter alſo; but till then ye cannot but make uſe of it both againſt your own <hi>Souls,</hi> and againſt Chriſt and his Truth.</p>
               <p>And then for ſetting up a natural Principle, we are further from that then ye are aware. For we are as ſhy of this, and jealous that it was a natural Principle as ye can be, and ſtarted from it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of us, till the Lord by his eternal Power, and demonſtration of his Spirit reached our hearts, and ſhewed us that it was the Seed of the Kingdom (even the Root of all the Spiritual life, that either we our ſelves formerly, or ever any elſe received at any time) and gave us the ſight of the things of the Kingdom in it, and at length wrought that in us, and for us by it, which never was wrought in us before, and which can be wrought by nothing elſe but the power of the Spirit. Now having certainly felt and known the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96896:7"/>
thing in our own hearts; and having alſo ſeen the Snares and Nets which the Enemy laies for you, whereby he keeps you from the true Bread, and from the Water and Wine of the Kingdom (even as he kept us formerly;) How can we hold our peace, but witneſs to you (in the love and drawings of the Spirit of the Lord) of the Truth, Life and Power which we have felt in Jeſus, though ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Enemies therefore? Nor do we this to bring you to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion or outward Way, (that is not our end) but that ye might feel the thing it ſelf, and know aſſuredly what is the Truth, in that which never was deceived it ſelf, nor ever deceived any, nor will ſuffer any to be deceived who are joyned to it, and abide in it. O why ſhould ye wander in the dark Opinions and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of the night? Why ſhould ye not rather come to that wherein the light of the day ſprings, and out of which it ſhines? And can the natural man (who hath his eyes) be deceived about the light of the natural day? Doth he not know the Light of the day, both from the lights, and alſo from the darkneſs of the night? Ten thouſand times more certain and inwardly ſatisfied is he, who is born of the ſpiritual Day, brought forth in the Light thereof, and who ſpiritually ſees, lives and walks therein. So that there is no doubt in him who is grown up into the thing; but he hath the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, (which is far above the aſſurance of outward ſenſe or reaſon) and the aſſurance of underſtanding. O bleſſed is he who hath an eye to ſee, an ear to hear, an heart to underſtand the things which God hath revealed by his <hi>Spirit</hi> in this our day, the living Way which he hath now made manifeſt, the principle of Life that he hath raiſed out of the Grave of Death. But he that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſpeaketh evil of this, (that will neither enter in himſelf, nor ſuffer others) he is far from receiving the bleſſing or bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Seed; but groweth up in the wrong nature and ſpirit, the end whereof is to be burned, with all that is in union with it, and groweth up from it. Therefore come out from that ſpirit, come out of that dark mind and nature, which never ſaw nor can ſee the Truth, (but ſetteth up Opinions and appearances of things inſtead of it) and receive the Anointing which is given with and in the <hi>Seed,</hi> which is raiſed in ſome, and viſited in many, in this day of the Lords Love and tender Mercy, to whom the Living, the Senſible, the Redeemed ſing praiſes, and on whom they wait,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96896:8"/>
for his further manifeſting of his Power and Glory in them daily more and more.</p>
               <p>Now Friends, if ye will know aright, or believe aright, ye muſt know and believe in him, who was with the Father before the World was; who was the Saviour, the Jeſus, the Chriſt, from everlaſting. For what makes him ſo? Is it not his Nature? Is it not the power of Salvation in him? His taking up a body made no alteration in him, added nothing to him; onely it was neceſſary that he ſhould take it up to fulfil the Will in it, and to offer it up a Sacrifice in his own Life and Spirit to the Father. This we firmly believe; and this alſo we cannot but ſay further, That the Virtue, the Value, the Worth, the Excellency of what was done by him in the Body, was not of the Body, but it was in him before time, in time, and will be after time, and for ever: Yea, it is he to whom the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> did of right belong before he took up the Body; and he only put forth in the Body, the ſaving Virtue which he had before, which belonged to the Nature, to the Anointing in him, whether ever he had ſaved any with it or no. And this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, this Life, this Spirit, this Nature of his, is the Food, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Garment of Life and Salvation, which he (through the death of the Body) made and prepared a living way for the Soul to come to, to feed on, and be cloathed with. I can hardly ſtop ſpeaking of theſe things for your ſakes, that through my words (or the words of whom the Lord ſhall pleaſe) ye might come to feel that which is able to give you the holy underſtanding, and might come to the true ſence and experience of the Truth it ſelf, and might ſee who hath blinded you, and how he hath blinded you, and fed you with Husks and dry food, inſtead of that which hath the true living Sap in it. But while ye ſee and judge in that which is wrong, ye muſt needs judge amiſs both of your ſelves and others, and alſo of the Truth it ſelf, and of the words ſpoken either formerly, or now concerning it; whereby ye expoſe and bring your ſelves under the righteous Judgment of the Truth it ſelf, even of the Son, and the Light of his Day, which hath power from the Father to judge all falſe appearances, deceits and deceivers.</p>

               <head>A <hi>POST-SCRIPT</hi> to the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Chriſtianity.</head>
               <p>IT hath pleaſed the Lord, as he manifeſted his Chriſt gloriouſly before the Apoſtacy; ſo to manifeſt him ſo again. For he was not only born (in the fleſh) of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but he was alſo born in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Woman cloathed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> which had the <hi>Moon</hi> under her feet, and on her head a Crown of twelve <hi>Stars.</hi> She alſo brought forth the Man-Child, who was to Rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Now of this appearance and return of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his freſh bringing forth of his Life and Power, in his Body, the Church, there are many Witneſſes, who have ſeen, felt and taſted thereof, with the Eyes and Sences which are of God, and of the new Birth. And of this (in the Love and good Will of God, and from the drawings and requirings of his <hi>Spirit</hi>) they bear witneſs to others; that they alſo might come to ſee the glory and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Day, and rejoyce therein. For indeed it is a glorious Day inwardly in Spirit, to thoſe that are quickened and gathered to the living Shepheard and Biſhop of the <hi>Soul,</hi> by the eternal Arm of his Power. And happy is the Eye that ſees the things that they ſee, and the Ear that hears what they hear, and the Heart that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the things which God hath revealed in and unto them by his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Glorious was the appearance of Chriſt in fleſh; but there were blocks in the way of the Jews, that they could not know, own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and receive him. And glorious is the adminiſtration of his life in <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this day of his Power: but there are alſo blocks lying in the way of them to whom it is ſent, which cauſe them to ſtumble at it, and keep them both from letting it into them, and alſo from giving up to it. But bleſſed was he who was not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt then; and bleſſed is he who is not offended at him now. For he that is offended at him, who is Life, and gives Life, ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96896:9"/>
at the preſent way of diſpenſation, which God hath choſen to give it out by, how ſhall he live? This is the cauſe that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor hearts lie mourning and grovelling on the earth, groaning becauſe of their ſins, fearing becauſe of the ſtrength of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the corruptions of their own hearts, which are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ready to betray them into his hands; becauſe they know not him, who hath ſtretched out his Arm, and is come in his Power to deliver; but are prejudiced againſt the way, wherein he hath and doth deliver. Yea, they know not his Voice who calls, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I am the Reſurrection and the Life. He that believeth in me, ſhall receive my ſtrength; and though he were never ſo weak, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as</hi> David; <hi>and though never ſo unclean, ſhall find the Waters, which ſpring from my Well to cleanſe him, and nouriſh him to Life everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How tenderly did Chriſt viſit the Jews, in the dayes of his fleſh? How powerfully, and in the true Authority of God, did he preach among them? What mighty Works did he ſhew? and yet they could not believe. Why ſo? The Enemy had entred them with his temptations, had got ſomewhat into their minds of a contrary nature, to keep out thereby the ſenſe, knowledge, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. So that when their hearts were even overcome with his Power and ſweet precious Doctrine, and ready to yeeld that this was he, this was Chriſt indeed; then the Enemy raiſed up ſome Argument or other to prejudice them againſt him, that he might thereby beat them off, and drive them back again from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receiving him. <hi>This man is not of God,</hi> ſay ſome; <hi>for he keepeth not the Sabbath.</hi> He cannot be a Prophet, ſay others, becauſe <hi>he is of</hi> Galilee, <hi>out of which no Prophet ariſeth.</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Chriſt, ſaith a third ſort, becauſe <hi>we know whence he is; but when Chriſt cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</hi> He is not holy, ſtrict, and zealous according to the Law, ſay others; but a looſe perſon, <hi>a man gluttonous, and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners;</hi> one who teacheth not his Diſciples to faſt and pray, (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did theirs, and <hi>John,</hi> who was generally looked upon as a Prophet, did his) but juſtifieth them in plucking the ears of Corn on the Sabbath Day, and ſo thereby rather incouraging them to break it, then ſtrictly to obſerve and keep it according to Gods Law. He is a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> ſay ſome, (ſpeaks moſt horrid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96896:9"/>
blaſphemy) <hi>making himſelf equal with God.</hi> He reproacheth the moſt ſtrict and zealous men that we have, (even our Teachers and Interpreters of the Law and Prophets) calling them <hi>Hypocrites, painted Sepulchres, blind Guides,</hi> &amp;c. and pronounceth Wo upon Wo againſt them. And thoſe that are <hi>the Children of Abraham,</hi> he calls the Children of the Devil, and ſaith, <hi>He that committeth ſin, is the Servant of ſin. But if the Son</hi> (meaning himſelf) <hi>make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And if we will have life in us, we muſt believe in him, and eat his fleſh, and drink his blood; (Did ever <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any of the Prophets teach ſuch Doctrine?) Again, he ſaith, <hi>If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death;</hi> whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets (who believed God, and kept his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) are all dead. This made them even conclude he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>John</hi> 8.52. So how could they underſtand him, when he ſaid, He was <hi>the good Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>the Door,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>that all that ever came before him were Thieves and Robbers?</hi> Would they not look upon this as witneſſing of himſelf, and endeavouring to ſet up himſelf? And when he ſaid, <hi>Verily, verily, before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am;</hi> Were they not ready to ſtone him, for ſpeaking a falſe and impoſſible thing, as it ſeemed to them, he manifeſtly being not yet fifty years old? But ſuppoſe it to be true, that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham,</hi> how then could he be the Meſſiah, who was to come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and out of the loyns of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Scriptures? And then for his Miracles, having beforehand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he was a bad Man, a Sinner, a breaker of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, a Blaſphemer, a deceiver of the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How eaſie was it for them to harden themſelves againſt them, and to infer that he wrought not theſe things by the power of God, but by the aid and aſſiſtance of the Devil, to overthrow the Laws and Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to ſet up himſelf and his new Doctrine by? Indeed many (and ſome ſeemingly ſtrong and unanſwerable) were the exceptions, which the wiſdom and underſtanding in them (which was out of the Life and Power of Truth) formed againſt Chriſt, whereby they juſtified themſelves in their refuſal of him, who was Sealed and ſent of the Father, and ſo excluded themſelves the Kingdom, and the Righteouſneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>This is paſt, and they can condemn them now, who themſelves are acting over again the ſame thing in ſpirit. It pleaſeth the Lord
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96896:10"/>
thus to ſuffer things to be, ſtill ſo to give forth the diſpenſations of his Life, as they alone that are in ſome meaſure of his Life can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them. And the ſame ſpirit (under a new guiſe) ſtill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Truth in its preſent appearance and diſpenſation, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth men up to flight and blaſpheme that holy Name and Power, which they that believe in, are ſaved and ſanctified by. Well, what ſhall I ſay to you? O that ye could diſcern Spirits! O that ye could ſee what ſpirit ye are of, and whom ye ſerve, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the preſent diſpenſation of Life! O that ye could ſee how ye read Scriptures out of that which wrote them, and bend them againſt that which wrote them, making your ſelves wiſe and ſtrong in a wrong Wiſdom and Knowledge, againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt, whom he hath ſet upon his holy Hill of Sion, and who appeareth there, though ye ſee it not. For Sion is not now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, or after the fleſh; (the Day is come, the Shadows are gone.) But Sion is the holy Hill of God in Spirit, upon which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem is built, which is revealed, come down, and coming down from Heaven, and many of the Heavenly Citizens dwell there already, and more are coming thither to dwell; for even from the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, ſhall the gathering be, to ſit with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, which Kingdom was received by the Chriſtians formerly before the Apoſtacy, and is now received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, bleſſed be his Name, who lives and reigns in Power, over all the ſpirits of darkneſs and deceit, maintaining his pure Life and Truth in the hearts of his Children, in deſpite of them all.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould ye thus err in Heart from the pure Truth? Why ſhould ye not open to him that knocks in his holy Power, and in the demonſtrations of his Spirit to your Conſciences? Why ſhould a ſubtile device of the deceiver be let in and hugged by you, to cauſe you to thruſt him back from your hearts, who is the Word of eternal Life, and with whom are the words of eternal Life? The Lord God diſcover the deep deceits of the Enemy to you, whereby he captivateth your hearts and underſtandings, that it may not be alwayes ſaid of you, as it was of the Jews, <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> But to as many as received him, he gave power in the day of his fleſh, and he giveth much more power to them that receive him in Spirit (in the Day of his Spirit) to

become Sons of God. And becauſe they are Sons, he poureth out abundantly of his Spirit upon them. And he that hath the Spirit, hath the Son; and he that hath the Son, hath Life. But he that hath not the Son, (but blaſphemeth the appearance and light of his Spirit) hath not life; but is yet in that Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is death, and which keeps him dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Lord, of his tender Mercy, make you ſenſible of, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your oppoſing and reſiſting his Truth, and alſo cauſe the Light of Life to ſhine in your hearts, quickening and guiding you thereby out of the Land of Death and Darkneſs, into the holy Land of Life; that all that ſincerely breath after Truth, may (through the faithful tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel) come to ſit down, dwell and feed together in it, in the one Power, in the one Life, in the one holy Spirit, where is pure Reſt and Peace, perfect Joy and Satisfaction for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>

Was it the body of fleſh? or was it He that was glorified with the Father before the World was? And who is to have the honour and exaltation? At whoſe Name is every knee to bow? Is not the reward to him, who laid down his Glory, to take upon him the body of fleſh, and appear in it, that he might honour, glorifie and fulfill the Will of his Father?</p>

Is it not from thence, that he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren, even becauſe he finds the Nature, Spirit and Life of his Father in them? What makes a Child to God? Is it not the being begotten of the Father, and born of the Spirit? And that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. Now mark; Have we the denomination and relation with Chriſt, from that which is Spiritual, and hath Chriſt himſelf the Name from, or becauſe of the body of fleſh? Nay, nay, the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> was from the anointing which was in the Body, which ran into, and filled the Veſſel. It is true, the Body in and by the Union, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes with him of his Name; but the Name belongs chiefly, and moſt properly, to the treaſure in the Veſſel.</p>

Did he not ſay it concerning that which had the power of Life in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it took up the Body, and had alſo the power of Life while it was in the Body, yea, and could raiſe up not only other bodies, but that alſo after it had laid it down?

               <p>

If I, or any one elſe have felt the ſaving Arm of the Lord revealed in us: If we have felt a meaſure of the ſame Life, Power and Anointing revealed in our Veſſels, as was revealed in his; Is it not of the ſame Nature? Is it not the ſame thing? Is not Chriſt the Seed? And is not this Seed ſown in the heart? Now if this Seed ſpring and grow up in me into a ſpiritual ſhape or form, (though it be but of a Babe) is not Chriſt then formed in me? If I be ingrafted into, and grow up in it, am I not ingrafted into Chriſt, (the true Olive-Tree, the true Vine) and do I not grow up in him? And is not this the ſame Chriſt that took upon him the body of fleſh, and offered it without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Is there any more than one, or is there any other than he? Is Chriſt divided? Is there one Chriſt within, and another without? He that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the leaſt meaſure of the thing, doth he not know the thing in ſome meaſure? And he that is in the leaſt meaſure of the thing, is he not in the thing? He that knoweth the Son, doth he not alſo know the Father? And he that knoweth the Spirit, doth he not alſo know the Son? And he that is in the Spirit, is he not in the Son? For they are one Nature and Being. A man may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the one, and not of the other; but their Nature, their Being, their Life, their Virtue is inſeparable. And as Chriſt ſaid concerning the Father, That he was in the Father, and the Father in him; and that he that ſaw him, ſaw the Father. So may it not be as truly affirmed (in the true ſence and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life) concerning Chriſt, That he is in the Spirit, and the Spirit in him; and that he that ſeeth the Spirit, ſeeth him; and that he that ſeeth him, ſeeth the Spirit? For he is the Spirit, according to that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Now the Lord is that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96896:12"/>
Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty.</hi> What to do? Why to ſee and read within the Vail, and to behold the glory of the Lord, which is revealed there; which they whom the Vail was over formerly, or whom the Vail is over now, have not liberty to do. Here is confuſion and impoſſibility to mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that Chriſt ſhould be all one with the Spirit; that Chriſt ſhould ſend the Spirit in his Name, and alſo himſelf be the Spirit whom he ſends. (This is an hard ſaying, who can bear it?) And yet this confuſion to man, is Gods Wiſdom, and pretious in their eye, who are taught of him.</p>
               <p>For it is one and the ſame Chriſt that was ſignified in Types and Shadows under the Law, revealed in the fulneſs of time in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Body, and afterwards in Spirit. Now after he was aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he received the Spirit ſo as he had not received him before; and ſo having received the Promiſe of the Father, he ſo diſpenſeth the Spirit to his Brethren and Diſciples, as it had not been diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before. Indeed he comforted and refreſhed his People under the Law by his holy Spirit, which was their inſtructer then, (<hi>Neh.</hi> 9.20.) and taught them the things of God under Types, Shadows and Reſemblances. When he came in the Body, he choſe out Diſciples, whom he taught the things of the Kingdom, and was a Refreſher and Comforter of them therein. (And was not this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter, than thoſe had under the Law? Had the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ever any ſuch Comforter, as Chriſt was to his Diſciples in his bodily preſence?) Now when he aſcends, he receives the Spirit from the Father, as the Father had promiſed him; and having ſo received him, he ſends him to them for their Comforter. And may not this juſtly be tearmed another Comforter, then Chriſt was in his bodily preſence; And yet is it not alſo the ſame Spirit of Life, that had been with them in that Body? So that it is another in the way of Adminiſtration, but the ſame in ſubſtance, even the Word which was from the beginning, the <hi>Spirit</hi> which was from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and to everlaſting; there is no other. Now as the Father ſent the <hi>Son,</hi> and yet was with, and in the <hi>Son;</hi> ſo the <hi>Son</hi> ſending the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he alſo is with, and in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And as it is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, that the ſame honour be given to the <hi>Son,</hi> as is given to him; ſo it is the <hi>Sons</hi> pleaſure, that the ſame honour be given to his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as is given to him.

               <p>He that knoweth the ſubſtance, the Seed of the Kingdom, the Birth of the Spirit, knoweth the Fleſh and Blood which is of the Seed. And this Fleſh is Fleſh indeed, this Blood is Blood indeed, even the Fleſh and Blood of the Seeds Nature; but the other was but the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, which he honoured in taking upon him, in which he did the Will, in which he offered up the acceptable Sacrifice; but yet did not give the honour from his own Fleſh and Blood to it. For the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, was not his own naturally, but only as he pleaſed to take it upon him and make it his. But that whereof he formeth us, (and which he giveth us to eat and drink) is the Fleſh and Blood of his own Nature: And this was it wherein was the Virtue, and wherein is the Virtue, Life and Power for ever. Happy, O happy is he who is of it, who is taken out of and formed of him, (as <hi>Eve</hi> was of <hi>Adam</hi>) and ſo becomes Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bone. Then will he know the Myſtery of Life, feed on the thing it ſelf, and not ſtumble about appearances and expreſſions, as thoſe that are out of, and from the thing it ſelf, do, through the darkneſs of their mind, and becauſe of their ignorance of the thing ſpoken of in the Scriptures.</p>

               <head>An Incitation to Profeſſors ſeriouſly to conſider, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they or we fail, in the true acknowledgment and owning of the Christ which died at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE, who are commonly called Quakers, being a People whom the Lord hath gathered (out of the wandrings, out of the many Profeſſions, out of the ſeveral ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered eſtates and conditions, wherein his Eye pittied us, and his love found us out) into a meaſure of the eternal Reſt; where we have found that Life, that Power, that manifeſtation of the eternal Spirit, and that redeeming Virtue, which we never were before diſtinctly acquainted with; I ſay, having taſted of this, having known this, having felt this, and come to a real enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, in ſome degree, in our ſeveral meaſures; we could not poſſibly conceal this Treaſure, but in bowels of love (and in the movings of the Life and Power of the Spirit) have been drawn to teſtifie of it to them who were left behind, groveling under the burthen of corruption, and crying out becauſe of the ſin and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage from the powers of darkneſs, who hath in a miſt withheld their eyes from beholding that living Virtue, which is able to ſave (and doth ſave, bleſſed be his Name) therefrom.</p>
               <p>Now this we have often found, That this our Teſtimony hath not been received in the ſame Spirit and Love, wherein it hath gone forth; but the Enemy (by his ſubtilty) hath raiſed up jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies concerning us, and prejudices againſt us, as if we denyed the Scriptures and Ordinances of God, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> profeſſing him only in words (to win upon others by) but denying him in reality and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>To clear this latter, (for my heart is only at this preſent drawn out concerning that) we have ſolemnly profeſſed, in the ſight of the Lord God (who hath given us the knowledge of his Son in Life and Power) theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we do really in our hearts own that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who came
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96896:17"/>
in the fulneſs of time, in that prepared Body to do the Fathers Will (his coming into the World, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in plainneſs and ſimplicity of heart, according as it is expreſſed in the Letter of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we own no other Chriſt then that, nor hold forth no other thing for Chriſt, but him who then appeared and was made manifeſt in fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now it would be nakedly inquired into by Profeſſors, What is the reaſon that their jealouſies ſtill remain concerning us, and why they are ſtill ſo ready to caſt this upon us? Certainly if they did know and own the ſame thing with us, (in the Spirit, and in the Power, in the Life, and in the Love which is of the Truth) this prejudice, and theſe hard thoughts could not remain. But if they themſelves do not know Chriſt in the Spirit (but only according to a relation of the Letter) no marvel though they miſs both of the Spirit, and of the true intent and meaning of the Letter, and likewiſe be liable to claſh againſt the Truth, as it is made manifeſt in others.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Lord hath ſhewen me in Spirit ſeveral times, that they themſelves are guilty of that very charge (and that he will ſo implead them at his Judgment Seat) which they caſt upon us, even of denying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> which died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For he that owneth the words of Scripture, as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends or conceives them in the reaſonings of his mind, and doth not wait to have them revealed in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> keeping out of his own reaſonings and conceivings, and waiting patiently till the Lord open the thing in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> he ſetteth up his own conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or an Image in his mind of the mind of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of the thing in ſelf, which alone is known in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by them who wait upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> there to receive it, and are not haſty to ſet up their own reaſonings and imaginations concerning the thing in the mean time.</p>
               <p>No man can in Truth call Jeſus the Lord, but by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> But any man, that is any thing ſerious, and weighs the Scriptures in the natural part, may ſo learn to acknowledge his coming into the World, and that he is Lord and King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may thus call him <hi>Lord,</hi> yea, and kindle a great heat in his affections towards him; but all this (out of the <hi>Life,</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) is but mans Image,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96896:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he forms in his mind, in his reading the Scriptures, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving things therefrom. But the true calling Jeſus <hi>Lord,</hi> is from the feeling of his eternal Virtue in the Spirit, and finding the Scriptures opened to him by the Spirit, in a Principle which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Reaſon, comprehends the Reaſon, and confounds and brings it to nothing.</p>
               <p>Again, There is no true Knowledge of Chriſt, no living Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, no ſaving Knowledge, no Knowledge which hath the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virtue in it; but that which is received and retained in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Light given by God to the Creature, in the Faith which is the Gift, in the Grace which is ſupernatural and ſpiritual, whereas the reaſoning part is but Natural. And ſuch as have received the Spiritual underſtanding, know it to be diſtinct from the Natural; and we experimentally find a very clear diſtinction, between Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſearched out by the reaſonings of the mind, (and ſo practiſes drawn therefrom) and Scriptures opened by the Spirit, and felt in the Life.</p>
               <p>Now that Profeſſors generally have not received their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt from the Spirit, or from Scriptures opened in the Spirit (and ſo know not the thing, but only ſuch a relation of the thing, as mans reaſoning part may drink in from the Letter of the Scriptures) is manifeſt by this, In that they are not able in Spirit and Underſtanding to diſtinguiſh the thing it ſelf, from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith it was cloathed, though the Scriptures be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs therein. Speak of Chriſt according to a Relation of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there they can ſay ſomewhat: but come to the Subſtance, come to the Spirit of the thing, come to the thing it ſelf; there they ſtutter and ſtammer, and ſhew plainly that they know not what it is.</p>
               <p>Now the Scriptures do expreſly diſtinguiſh between Chriſt, and the Garment which he wore; between him that came, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in which he came; between the Subſtance which was vailed, and the Vail which vailed it. <hi>Lo I come, a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> There is plainly He, and the Body in which he came. There was the outward Veſſel, and the inward Life. This we certainly know, and can never call the bodily Garment <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that which appeared and dwelt in the Body. Now if ye indeed know the <hi>Chriſt</hi> of God, tell us plainly what that is which appeared in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96896:18"/>
the Body? whether that was not the <hi>Chriſt</hi> before it took up the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, after it took up the Body, and for ever?</p>
               <p>And then their confining of Chriſt to that Body, plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth that they want the knowledge of him in Spirit. For Chriſt is the Son of the Father, he is the infinite eternal Being, one with the Father, and with the Spirit, and cannot be divided from either; cannot be any where, where they are not; nor can be excluded from any place where they are. He may take up a Body and appear in it, but cannot be confined to be no where elſe but there, no not at the very time while he is there. Chriſt, while he was here on Earth, yet was not excluded from being in Heaven with the Father at the very ſame time, as he himſelf ſaid concerning himſelf, <hi>The Son of Man which is in Heaven,</hi> John 3.13. Nor was the Father excluded from being with him in the Body, but the Father was in him, and he in the Father, whereupon he ſaid to <hi>Philip, He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> What, did every on that ſaw that Body, ſee the Father alſo? Nay not ſo, but be that ſaw Chriſt the Son of the living God, whom fleſh and blood revealed not, but the Father only (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17.) he ſaw the Father alſo.</p>
               <p>O Friends, look to your knowledge of Chriſt, and to your Faith and Knowledge of the Scriptures, and to your Prayers alſo; for it is eaſie miſſing of the living ſubſtance in all theſe, and meeting with a ſhadow, which may pleaſe and make a great ſhew in the earthly part, in the natural underſtanding and affections, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth not the Soul, or that which is born after the Spirit, but ſtill the cry there goes out (where the Soul is awakened) after Truth, Subſtance, Life, Virtue from Gods Spirit in the Spirit, which it alone can feed upon.</p>
               <p>Theſe four things following, I am certain of, which he that cometh into the true Light, ſhall infallibly experience them there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That nothing can ſave but the knowledge of Chriſt, even of that very Chriſt and no other, who took upon him the prepared Body, and offered it up at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> can ſave, but the living Knowledge. Not a knowledge of him after the Letter, (which the carnal part may get much of, and value it ſelf much by) but a knowledge of him in the Spirit; which is only given to that which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96896:18"/>
is begotten and born of the Spirit, and only retained by that which abides and remains in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and runs not out into the fleſhly reaſonings, imaginings and conceivings, about the things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That that man who knoweth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor keepeth cloſe to him in <hi>Spirit;</hi> but (through darkneſs and miſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſpirit of deceit) calleth the ſhinings of his Light (his reproofs, his checks for that which is evil, and his ſecret motions to that which is good) natural; This man, though he ſeem to own <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſo much according to the Letter, yet in Truth denies him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that denies <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (in his knockings and viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him in his own heart, and before men in the Truths which he holds forth by his Servants and Miniſters of his <hi>Spirit</hi>) him will he deny before his Father in Heaven.</p>
               <p>O, I beſeech you, do not trifle about theſe things (for they are exceeding weighty) leſt ye periſh from the way; for miſſing of the Saviour, ye muſt needs alſo miſs of the Salvation. O that ye knew your ſtate, as God knows it to be, and as it is ceatainly known and felt in the meaſure of his Life and holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> by thoſe whom God hath gathered together, and whoſe eyes he hath opened, and preſerveth open there, Glory be to his Name therefore: <hi>Yea, Glory, Glory, Glory, and everlaſting Praiſes be ſung to him throughout all the holy Land, yea in the very heights of Sion, by the Souls of the Redeemed, from henceforth, and for evermore, Amen: whoſe Mercy, Love, Grace, Wiſdom, Power and rich Goodneſs remaineth and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever; by and in which the Redeemed live to his Praiſe, who have overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, whoſe Blood they know what it is; and none elſe knoweth it, but they who feel the ſprinkling and virtue of it. Lo this is our God, we have waited for him; and how can we but be glad, and rejoyce in his Salvation! O let all that live by the breath of thy Power, and drink of thy Streams, ſing praiſe unto Thee, and exalt thy great and wonderful Name for ever and ever.</hi>

She her ſelf is the ſame in all; but her ſtate is different, according to the wiſdom and good pleaſure of him, who variouſly diſpoſeth of her.

That henceforward (ſince this ſeparation) the Believers or true Jews are not to be expected in the outward Court (in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thereof, wherein they were found before this ſeparation,) but the unbelievers, the Gentiles (who have not the true Nature, but at beſt but the appearance of the Jew) are to be expected there; and the true Jew is to be looked for and found more inward.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That therefore which allureth to look for God there (and to wait for him in the wayes and worſhips of that Court, all this time of the ſeparation) is not the true <hi>Spirit</hi> (which rightly guideth the ſimple heart to the place where God appears, and where he is to be waited for) but the wrong ſpirit, who when he cannot ſtifle the ſimplicity, and hinder it from breathing and ſeeking after God, waits to draw aſide and miſlead it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the great way of that ſpirits miſguiding and miſleading the honeſt heart, in its breathing and longing ſtate, is not by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect taking it off from ſeeking after God, but rather by pointing it to a way to ſeek him in, wherein he once appeared, and was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is now withdrawn from.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:96896:20"/>8. He that will keep cloſe to God, and not be withdrawn from him, muſt watch to his Spirit, and know the leadings of it, elſe he will not follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes, but ſtay behind in ſome obſervation or practice which the Lamb is gone out of, and ſo miſs of his Leader, and meet (inſtead thereof) with another Leader, even the ſpirit of Antichriſt, who enters into the outward Court and outward practiſes, ſo ſoon as ever the Spirit of God hath left them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That Gods People, ſince his withdrawing inward, and giving the outward Court to the Gentiles, have been much deceived by the Antichriſtian Spirit, and led captive into <hi>Babylon;</hi> in ſo much as God, when he cometh to overthrow Antichriſt, with the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> of his building, finds them there, and calls them out from thence. For the light growing low, and the deceit great, and that ſpirit ſubtile; how can the poor, weak innocent Babe eſpy that ſpirit, and eſcape his ſnares, when he tempts to thoſe very paths and wayes of worſhip, wherein the Saints had walked and met with God, before the Spirit of the Lord departed out of them and gave them up to the Gentiles?</p>
               <p n="10">10. That there is danger to the People of God of not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Call out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but abiding there, through the ſubtile entanglements of the falſe ſpirit, who bewitcheth (with the Cup of Fornication) to make <hi>Babylon</hi> appear as <hi>Sion,</hi> her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as the Truths of the Goſpel, her ordinances and wayes of worſhip, as the true Ordinances and wayes of Worſhip. For the deceit is exceeding deep, and the myſtery of iniquity very great, following that heart cloſe, which the Lord is drawing to depart therefrom; and if the Lord God were not ſtrong and vigilant, who judgeth the Whore, ſhe would ſtill keep her hold of the heart; and if the heart be not kept very cloſe to the Lord in the Judgement, it cannot come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but will ſtill be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and held in ſome part or other of the myſtery of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Such of the People of God, as do not wait to underſtand and receive the full Call, and ſo do not follow the Lord perfectly, out of that City of Abominations; but by her ſubtilties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward witchcrafts, are held captive therein, and found in any part thereof when the Lord cometh to judge her; ſuch muſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96896:20"/>
partake of her Plagues from the hand of the Lord, who will not ſpare her, nor the ſpirits of his deareſt People who are found there, in the day of his viſitation and righteous judgments.</p>
               <p>Therefore come out of her, come out of her, O ye that love your Souls, and the pure Preſence and freſh Light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Ye that know what it is to provoke him to jealouſy, and fear the weight of his hand upon your ſpirits; ye that love the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, the holy City, and Temple of the living God, O come out of that impure building, that fleſhly building, thoſe fleſhly wayes and worſhips which that ſpirit adorneth, to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if they were ſpiritual. O depart ye, depart ye out of your new removes; for they are alſo polluted, and not your reſt; but ſhort of that wherein the Reſt, the Peace, the Preſence of the Lord of Life is felt by others, and to be found by you.</p>
               <p>And conſider this, if ever ye will come to the holy City, which was once built in the dayes of the Apoſtles, but (ſince the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it from the outward Court) hath been trodden down, and trampled under the feet of the unbelievers, even while they have been worſhipping in the outward Court (which God once built and choſe, but afterwards withdrew his Spirit from, and gave up to the unbelievers) I ſay, if ever ye will come to this holy City, the holy Land wherein it is built, and the holy Hill whereon it is founded, ye muſt paſs through the Wilderneſs, be exerciſed in the Wilderneſs, even till ye are fitted for it, and not ſtrive to raiſe up a building your ſelves in the likeneſs of it, but wait till God hath hewen and prepared the ſtones by his Spirit, and then (by the skil of the ſame ſpirit) build up his <hi>Sion</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the fear of the Lord conſider ſeriouſly, meekly, humbly and brokenly, that the Lord may manifeſt your preſent ſtate and condition unto you, Whether ye have not erred in theſe things as well as others, and have not cauſe to repent of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs herein, and to acknowledge that your buildings have been raiſed in the forwardneſs of your own ſpirits, and in the confidence of your reaſonings upon Scripture-words, without feeling the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (guidance and holy Power) of Gods Spirit raiſing up the Foundation of many Generations, and rearing his own pure Houſe upon his own holy Mountain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96896:21"/>In the Lords hand is the time and ſeaſon of building his own houſe. <hi>David,</hi> though his deſire was approved, yet might not build the outward Temple in the time of his choice; but Gods time and ſeaſon was to be waited for, both for the firſt building, and for the rebuilding of it. There is likewiſe a ſeaſon for the rebuilding of Spiritual <hi>Sion,</hi> after the long captivity of it in Myſtery-Babylon. Now he that is forward, building before the time and ſeaſon of the Spirit, buildeth without the Spirit; and his building is not of the Spirit, but of the nature of <hi>Babylon</hi> (which is wholly to be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from and left behind, in the Souls travels and progreſs towards <hi>Sion:</hi>) And what ever is of the nature of <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt at length fall with <hi>Babylon,</hi> (in the day of her terrible Judgement) if the Lord in mercy do not ſhake it, and cauſe it to fall before.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O all Profeſſor, awaken out of the fleſh and all fleſhly reaſonings, into the Spirit of Life; and examine there both your inward and outward buildings, that your loſs be not great, and your anguiſh unutterable in the Day of the Lord, when all thoſe buildings, which are raiſed and preſerved in the pure Life and Power, ſhall ſhine in the beauty and glory of Gods Spirit, and the greateſt glory of fleſh, and fleſhly buildings, fade and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               </head>
               <p>EArly in the morning, on the 26th day of the ſixth month, 1666. this, in the freſhneſs and quick ſenſe of Life, ſprang up in my heart again and again. O <hi>England, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, England,</hi> how good had it been for thee, that thou hadſt known and walked in the way of Peace!</p>
               <p>There is a way of Peace, for Perſons and Nations to know and walk in; but every Perſon and Nation doth not know and walk in this way, but rather in the way of trouble.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the way of Peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the way of the pure Wiſdom, the way of the Light, and guidance of God's Spirit, from whom the Creature came, and by whom alone it can be rightly ordered. He that waiteth on him for Counſel, he that ſubjecteth to, and walketh in his Counſel, he walketh in the way of Peace.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the way of Trouble?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way of a mans own Wiſdom and Counſel. For a Man or Nation to do that, which is right in their own eyes. This is the way of Man, whereby he thinks to eſtabliſh himſelf, and put an end to his Troubles; but he errs therein, as in the end he ſtill finds to his Woe.</p>
               <p>Now O <hi>England</hi> conſider, Haſt thou had the guidance of God? Hath the Light, which hath guided thy ſteps, been lighted by him, or by his and thy Souls Enemy? For there is a Spirit (of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature to God) near Man, which he ſuddenly taketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of, when his heart is not acquainted with, nor receiveth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Lord. And this Counſellor is the deſtroyer both of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Nations, leading them in wayes of ruine and ſubverſion, under an appearance of being the properwayes of Peace and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:96896:22"/>It is true of Nations as well as Perſons, that what they ſow, that ſhall they alſo reap. God meaſureth out their time unto them; and when that is over, his time of judging and pleading with them comes. And woe is then unto them, who have acted in their own wills and wiſdoms, out of the pure Counſel and fear of the Lord, wherein they ſhould have ſtood and been guided.</p>
               <p>It is a day of trouble and diſtreſs. The weight of the iniquity of this Nation begins to be felt upon it. O let every one ſearch, and bow before the Lord under his righteous Judgements; that there may be no going on in that, which bringeth and will increaſe the judgement; but a turning towards that which interceeds, and opens the ſprings of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Two things lie heavy on this Nation, to wit, a running on in Tranſgreſſions of ſeveral kinds againſt the Lord (forgetting his tender Mercies, with the dayes of former diſtreſs) and an afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others whom he loves, and hath led, and is leading out of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. O that theſe things might come to an end, that the anger of the Lord might ceaſe, and the wayes of his Judgements and pleading with this Nation be ſtopped; for who can ſtand before him, when he riſeth up in controverſie againſt them?</p>
               <p>There is but one eye, which can rightly ſee the Hand and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Lord;</hi> yea it pleaſeth the <hi>Lord</hi> ſo to manage them, that only the eye which is of him may ſee them. Man muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Wiſdom, and caught in the ſnare of his own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He that will ſee the Things of God, the Wayes of God, the Counſels of God, the Love and Sweetneſs of God (yea the very Judgments of God) muſt receive from him the eye that ſeeth them. O that men might feel after, and come into that, wherein they might be pittied and ſpared by their Maker. Man muſt bow; that which is of God in man (which hath long lain under oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) muſt be exalted. It is the day of his Power, and he will reign in it. O happy they that bow to his Scepter, and kiſs the ſhinings of his Light (even in the ſharpeſt rebukes of it in their hearts) that they may turn from, and travel out of the darkneſs (where is death, deſtruction, and miſery, even in all the counſels and wayes of it) and come into unity with that which is pure, and live.</p>

               <head>A faithful Guidance to the Principle and Path of Truth, wherein eternal Life is witneſſed, by thoſe who are born thereof, and walk therein.</head>
               <p>THere muſt be ſomewhat let down from God into a mans heart, to change his heart, and redeem it to God, or he cannot be ſaved. He muſt receive a Seed, be born of a new and incorruptible Seed, or he cannot be renewed from his corrupt nature and ſtate. He muſt be born of Water and Gods Spirit, or he cannot enter into Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now this is the true Religion, namely, to experience and be ſubject to that Power which redeems to God, which breaks the power of the wicked one in the heart, firſt caſting him out, and then taking poſſeſſion of the Veſſel, and filling it with the holy Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how may a man meet with ſuch a thing as this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture (which giveth a faithful Teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Truth) ſaith; Chriſt, the Word of Faith which the Apoſtles preached, is nigh. Inſomuch as a man need not ſay, Who ſhall go up or down to fetch it? but what ſaith it? <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart.</hi> This is that which reconciles to God, cutting down and ſlaying the enmity by the Power of the Croſs, and bringing up the Seed. This is the Adverſary in the way of the ſinner, which he that maketh peace with, ſhall be remitted all his treſpaſſes paſt, and find power and ſtrength againſt ſin for the time to come, as he is gathered into and brought forth in his pure Life and Nature.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I know and receive this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That in the heart which is contrary to ſin, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth ſin, which witneſſeth againſt ſin, and is drawing the mind from it, furniſhing thoſe with a new and holy ability, who wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Lord</hi> in it; that, that is the thing, though in never ſo little a Seed or low meaſure. Now he that minds this, harkens to this,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96896:23"/>
turns from what this (in its pure unerring Light) ſhews to be evil, follows (in the will, ſtrength and ability which is of this) what this ſhews to be good, he receives it; and waiting upon it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming daily ſubject to it, ſhall grow up in it, increaſe in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and acquaintance with it, and receive of it daily more and more. And thus the man whoſe way was vile, whoſe heart was naught, formed in wickedneſs, filled with corruption, daily bringing forth ſin and fruits unto death, ſhall find theſe (by the pure Light, and holy inſtructions of Life) daily purged out of him, and Chriſt formed in him, and the holy Fruits of Righteouſneſſe brought forth through his Veſſel, by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt, to the Glory of God the Father.</p>
               <p>And then being in Chriſt, being in the Principle of his Life and acting therein, here is peace in the Soul, reſt to it from its Enemies and Gods Judgments, and acceptance with the Father in what the Soul thus is and works.</p>
               <p>But then the World will perſecute and hate exceedingly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Soul, who thus ſubmits to God, and is thus changed by him, is not of the World, but of the Father which begat it in Chriſt, and formeth it in his image and likeneſs.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in this Light, the eyes are opened to reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to underſtand therein the conditions of the People and Saints of the moſt High in former Generations, and how the wicked ſpirit wrought then, to oppoſe the Truth and People of God, and to draw men into deceit. Yea, and many other wayes the Scriptures are exceeding ſweet and uſeful, being read in that which giveth the true ſenſe and underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p>But let him that once putteth his hand to the Plow (beginning to feel ſomewhat of God, and to ſubject unto it, and ſo to taſte of the Peace and pureneſs of it) never look back to the World, nor mind the temptations and oppoſitions he will meet with from that nature and ſpirit, either in himſelf or others; for if he do, he will never be able to travel on, but rather conſult with fleſh and blood, and ſo return back into <hi>Egypt</hi> and loſe the Crown, which is laid up for thoſe who paſs on through the Wilderneſs, through the Tryals, through the Temptations, through the Wants, through the various Exerciſes to their journeys end.</p>
               <p>This is the Path of Life in brief, happy is he who feels the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96896:23"/>
guider into it, and faithfully follows him therein to the end.</p>
               <p>There is another Queſtion ſprings up in my heart, which is this.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a man come to have his ſins waſhed away by the Blood of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By coming into the Light, and walking in the Light, which diſcovers the Blood, and wherein alone it is ſprinkled by God, and felt by the Soul, he may receive the cleanſing which is by it. This is according to the Teſtimony of Scripture, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> By the Light the darkneſs is diſpelled, and in the Light the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and filth is waſhed away by the Blood, and the Soul (Mind and Conſcience) cleanſed from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This then is the Meſſage that we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> verſ. 5. What then? Why then, they that will know God, and walk with God, muſt by the Virtue of his Truth be turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; (as <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.) and in that Light he ſhall meet with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and have fellowſhip with them, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and ſhall be waſhed (both with the Water, and with the Blood) and kept clean and pure thereby in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I come into the Light, and how may I walk therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is the Light. (He is the Light of the World, the Light of Men, the Light of Life.) And thou needeſt not ſay in thine heart, Who ſhall go up to Heaven, or down into the deep for him? for he is near in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the Word of Faith, which thou art to believe in, love and obey; that in the love, faith and obedience thereof, thine heart may be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and thou mayeſt live. This is the Goſpel of our Salvation, even this Chriſt, this Word, this Light, this Life which redeems from ſin; which deſtroyeth the deſtroyer, and ſetteth the Soul free to ſerve and live to the Lord. This was the Meſſage the Apoſtles had to deliver in their day, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.) And this was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Meſſage too, when he ſpake concerning the new Covenant. For <hi>Moſes</hi> did not only deliver the old Covenant, but he alſo ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the new, (even another Covenant than that of Mount
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96896:24"/>
                  <hi>Horeb,</hi> Deut. 29.1.) And the Word of this other Covenant, was not the Law written in Tables of Stone, but the Word nigh in the mouth and heart, <hi>chap.</hi> 30.14.</p>
               <p>Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that place ſpeaks of doing, (which is the Voice of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Do this and live) but the new Covenant ſtands in believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The end of Faith is obedience. Why do I believe Chriſt, but that I may receive the Law of his Spirit, and walk before him in the newneſs of the obedience thereof? And he that obeys, is of the Faith, and in the Truth; and he that obeys not, is out of it; is not in the Power, not in the Life which brings forth the obedience; ſo out of the thing which redeems, and in which the redemption is witneſſed. But he that obeys, he that doth the Will, he is in the Righteouſneſs, in the Power, in the Life from which the obedience ſprings.</p>
               <p>And here the waſhing and purifying of the Soul is truly known and witneſſed. Outward Sacrifices under the Law were vain, as to cleanſing the Soul; and an outward belief (of what Chriſt did and ſuffered) effects not the thing known. What then? The new Creature doth. The pure Faith doth. The pure Obedience doth. It did it formerly, it doth it ſtill, and nothing elſe can do it. <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations; but waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well,</hi> &amp;c. But how ſhould this be? could they ever attain this by the old Covenant? Nay, but <hi>Moſes</hi> had not only delivered them the old Covenant, but alſo had directed them to the new, to the Word of Faith, to the Word of Life and Power in the heart and mouth, through the obedience whereof they might waſh themſelves (as <hi>Peter</hi> even in the Goſpel-times ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22.) put away the evil of their doings; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what then? Why then they ſhould receive the cleanſing through the Blood of the Lamb; for then, though their ſins were as Scarlet, they ſhould be as white as Snow; though they were red like Crimſon, they ſhould be as Wool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Micah</hi> tells them, (when they asked, how they might come before God to pleaſe him?) <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Mich. 6.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96896:24"/>Where, or how doth God ſhew this to man? Had not <hi>Moſes</hi> told that before, to wit, by the Word nigh in the mouth and heart? There is ſomewhat near man, even in his mouth, which divides his words one from another, ſhewing him (at ſometimes, and would do it oftner if he heeded it) which are bad words, and which are good words. What is that that doth this? The ſame thing alſo is in his heart, as a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents thereof, ſhewing him when there is a good thought, deſire or intention in his mind, and when there is a bad or wicked one. What is this? O that men knew what it is! O that they could fear the Lord, and become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, and they ſhould know what it is.</p>
               <p>Every man that will be ſanctified, and inherit Gods Kingdom, muſt be born of the Will of God. He muſt deny his own Will (as Chriſt did; Not my Will, ſaid he, Father, but thine be done) that muſt be crucified. He muſt ſuffer in the fleſh, die to the fleſh; and live in and to the holy Nature and Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now thus a man comes to be born of the pure Will, to wit, by hearing the Word nigh in the mouth and heart, and becoming ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it. This cuts down his own will day by day, and brings up the Will and Nature of God in him, through which he is changed and ſanctified, and becometh a new Creature. For the old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is made up of the old underſtanding and will; but the new Creature is made up of the new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherewithall ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? By taking heed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Word,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> What Word was that? Was it the Word of the old Covenant, or the Word nigh in the mouth and heart? And, <hi>Thy Word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a Lanthorn to my Feet, and a light to my Path.</hi> What Word was that? the Word of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Word of the ſecond? <hi>The Law of the Lord is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, converting the Soul.</hi> What Law is that? <hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple.</hi> What Teſtimony is that? <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart.</hi> What Statutes are they? (were not the Statutes of the old Covenant heavy and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome?) <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> What Commandment is that? Yea, what is that which is <hi>ſweeter than the Honey, &amp; the Honey-comb,</hi> which overcomes with its ſweetneſs? O that men could read! O that men could ſee the thing which is pure, and maketh pure; which is righteous, and maketh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96896:25"/>
righteous. After men have ſeen the thing, there is a great way to travel to it; but how far are they off, who do not ſo much as ſee it, but are in the darkneſs and prejudices of that Nature and Spirit, which is contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Now if the Lord, in his tender mercy and love to thy Soul, bring thee to a ſenſe of this thing, &amp; thou beginneſt to feel this precious ſearching Word diſcovering any evil to thee, either in thy heart or wayes: O do not diſpute, do not reaſon againſt it, but bleſs the diſcoverer, bow to the Son, become obedient immediately, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following the Lamb therein, leſt he remove his Light from thee, and ſuffer darkneſs and the diſputing wiſdom to overtake thee.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not of the World, and he leads out of the World. Out of its vanities, wayes, cuſtoms, faſhions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A man cannot ſerve Chriſt and the World. Can any man be born of the Father, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him out of the Spirit of the World; and yet live in that, walk in that which is not of the Father, but of the World? which came from the worldly part, is of the worldly part, nouriſheth and pleaſeth the worldly part in man, but pleaſeth not the Father? Can that man who is not of the World, but of the Father, do any thing that upholdeth the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, or the pride of life, either in himſelf or others? Doth not the Spirit of the Lord, where it is hearkened to, draw out of theſe, and out of all things which are of theſe? Therefore conſider well what it will coſt, and how hard it is to follow Chriſt; that thou who deſireſt to be the Lords, mayeſt receive help and ſtrength from him to be faithful, that in his ſtrength thou mayeſt overcome all that ſtands between thee and Life, that ſo thou mayeſt receive the Crown, and inherit the Kingdom which is prepared for, and given to the Faithful, who labour and fight not in vain, but gain ground and conquer (yea, at length become more then conquerors) through the Mercy, Love, Might and Power of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>WHO is the good Shepherd of the Sheep?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Wiſdom, Life and Power of the Father (which dwelleth in, and is manifeſt through the Son) is the Shepherd. He that is the Truth, the Way, and the Life, he alſo is the Shepherd and Biſhop of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Who are the Sheep?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They that are born of this Wiſdom, gathered by this Life, turned to this Power, they are the Sheep. They who are changed by him into his Nature, they are of him; Sheep of him the Shepherd, Lambs of him the Lamb, Doves of him the Dove.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Which is the Fold of the Sheep?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Wiſdom, Life and Power of the Father, even the ſame that is the Shepherd. The Fathers Hand wherewith he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them, wherein he incloſeth them, that is the Fold. For it is the Power, Wiſdom and Life of the Father, which gathereth the Sheep; and he gathereth them into his Power, into his Wiſdom, into his Life; and that is a Wall or Fold about them.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is not the Church the Fold?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This in the Church, or the Church in this, is the Fold; but not out of this. For there is no ſafety or preſervation among any ſort or gathering of people, but as they ſtand and abide in this. And ſtanding and abiding in this, they have Authority and Power from the chief Biſhop of the Soul; but none out of this.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Who is the Door?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Shepherd is the Door alſo, who lets into the Fold, and ſhuts out at his pleaſure; and none can rightly enter but by him.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>What are they that run before the Power, or farther than the Power leads and guides them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are Thieves and Robbers; and they may deſtroy the life and freſhneſs in thoſe that are not watchful, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help to ſave or build up; becauſe they themſelves are out of that, come out of that, and act out of that, which alone can do it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>How may the Sheep be diſcerned from the Goats, and from ſuch alſo as put on the Sheeps cloathing, but yet are not ſheep in Nature and Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By their Lamb-like Nature, by the meekneſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in them which is of the Lamb; which none can have, but they that are of him; for it is not to be found in mans nature, nor to be attained by his Art. They alſo know and hear the Voice of the Word nigh in the mouth and heart, and follow the Law of his Spirit, received from his mouth; which none elſe, but his Sheep, do or can do; for this is given by him, and it is given by him only to his Sheep.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>What doth Chriſt the Shepherd (the eternal Word, the Wiſdom, Life and Power of the Father) do for his Sheep?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He doth great things for them, which utter who can; but happy is he that feels and knows them. He gives them a new Nature, a new Spirit, a new Heart, a new Name, which none knoweth but he that hath it; for it is written on the white ſtone, which none elſe receives, nor none elſe can read, but he that hath the eye which is of him, what is written thereon. He giveth them eternal <hi>Life,</hi> he leadeth them into the poſtures of <hi>Life,</hi> he, giveth them to drink of the Waters of <hi>Life.</hi> He patteth them forth out of the Priſon-houſe, out of the Chains and Fetters, out of the Darkneſs, out of the Bonds, and from under the burthens of the Soul, into the pure Light and liberty of the Spirit, where they taſte, know and enjoy of his freedom, and dwell with him, and reſt with him, and lie down with him, and riſe up with him, even in the ſame eternal Life, Spirit and Power, wherein his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96896:26"/>
dwelling-place is. And all this they enjoy ſafely, hearkening to the Voice of the Shepherd, and turning from the voice of the ſtranger, which it is natural to them to do. For being turned from man, born of that which is immortal, and keeping to that; that ear which is there received, will alone hearken to the Voice of him who is Immortal; and the voice of the ſtranger (who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelf) is preſently diſcerned and turned from, by him that heareth with the true ear. <hi>The Lord God, who is the Spring and Fountain of all good, inflame people with deſires after the pure Life, and holy Nature, which is of and from Chriſt the Seed, his Son; and ſatisfie thoſe deſires which are ſingly and uprightly after him.</hi>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>GLorious was the eſtate of the Church, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, for Purity of Doctrine, for holy Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, for Love to God, one to another, and to all men (even of Enemies) for Faith in God, for the Preſence and Power of his Spirit among them (inſomuch as the unbeliever coming among them, might find his heart and ſtate reached to, and be forced to confeſs and report that God was in them of a truth) for ſingleneſs and uprightneſſe of Heart, meekneſs and innocency of Spirit and Converſation, for zeal for God and his Truth, ſuffering the ſpoiling of their Goods, Impriſonments, Stripes, and many other wayes, both from the Heathen, and alſo from the profeſſing Jews, who had been the Church once. O what ſhall I ſay concerning the beauty and lovelineſs of that State! Ye that would know it,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96896:27"/>
O wait to feel it in that, which giveth the true ſence of it.</p>
               <p>But over this glorious State, came a dark, thick, corrupt night, wherein the Kernel was loſt, and the Shell defaced; wherein the Houſe, which had been ſwept and garniſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came again recovered and poſſeſſed by the wicked ſpirit. And how great hath this darkneſs been! O what a kind of Church hath appeared in the World, wherein the ſpirit of Enmity hath dwelt and acted in men, under the Name of Chriſtianity! So that inſtead of loving and ſeeking the good of Enemies, they are ready to rend and tear one another for every little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and will be Lords over mens Faith, requiring men to practiſe things in Religion, before the Spirit of the Lord teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſo to do, which the Apoſtles did not. For though they had from God the expreſs knowledge of what was Truth, and could certainly inſtruct and build men up therein; yet they were not Lords over mens Faith; but if men were otherwiſe mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then according to what they knew and taught, they could wait and bear with them, bidding them walk ſo far as they had attained, and God in his due time would reveal the reſt alſo. O that men were come to this Spirit again! Then they would be Chriſtians indeed, and then they might be known to be Chriſts Diſciples, by their loving the Brethren and fellow-Diſciples. But without this love, mens Religion is but as a tinkling Cymbal, making a noiſe and ſound of ſomewhat, but not having the true Nature or Virtue of Religion in it.</p>
               <p>Now will it not be a glorious Day, when the Spirit of the Lord cleanſeth away this thick darkneſs, and cauſeth the Light of his pure Truth to ariſe and appear again? Why there is ſuch a Day to be, wherein the true Church (which was reproached and driven into the Wilderneſs) is to come out of the Wilderneſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96896:27"/>
again, and her Witneſſes ſtand on their feet again, and her Seed to ſpring up in the Power of Life, following the Lamb, who marcheth on fighting with the Sword of the Spirit (the words of his mouth) conquering and to conquer thereby the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Antichriſtian World, even as he did at firſt the corrupt Heatheniſh World. The Lord will purifie his Temple, and cleanſe the World, by the Plagues of his Angels which he hath prepared, making way for the beauty of his Truth, and the Church of his gathering; wherein he will bring forth his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, wherein his Power ſhall appear, wherein his Preſence ſhall be made manifeſt, wherein that which ſhined before in the Primitive Church, ſhall ſhine again in this new-reared Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his, inſomuch as men ſhall be forced to ſay, <hi>This is the Church of Chriſt indeed, God is here of a truth; This is the Goſpel-Jeruſalem indeed, which is built upon the holy Hill of</hi> Sion, <hi>in which Innocency, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Truth, Love, Sweetneſſe, Peaceableneſſe, and the gentle Nature and Spirit of the Lamb lives and reigns; and the Lord bleſs thee, O Habitation of Juſtice, and Mountain of Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of a truth this Work is begun. The times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are come from the Preſence of the Lord. The Lord hath heard from Heaven, pittying the cries of his Seed, and hath viſited their Souls, cauſing the Light of Life (even the pure Light of the everlaſting Covenant) to ſhine upon their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. But whoever would know theſe things, and partake of them, muſt come in at the Door, by the Guidance of the Spirit, through the Light which is with him. And he that would enjoy the full Light (even the ſhinings forth of the Sun at noon day) muſt begin with its glimmerings, even that in the heart, which diſcovereth and draweth out of the corrupt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96896:28"/>
ſtate of the World, towards the Father. O hear and live. Do not diſpute about it, but wait to feel it; upon the feeling of it, deſpiſing the ſhame, and taking up, and enduring the Croſs, and ſo bearing the reproach and ſufferings of Chriſt in thy Age and Generation. And as thou obeyeſt, thou ſhalt know of its Doctrine; but out of the pure Faith and Obedience, there is no true, ſound, deep, rooted knowledge; but all of that kind muſt be parted with, for the knowledge which is of the Faith, and which is made manifeſt and increaſed in the Obedience; which knowledge is of a far more excellent Kind and Nature. than that which thou art to part with for it. The Lord guide thy Mind, and ſtretch forth his Hand to help thee, who from the leaſt touch of a true Nature and Spirit, deſireſt after the pure Truth and way of eternal Life. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Teſtimony (here held forth) is faithful and true, and (I know) the Witneſs of God in many hearts will anſwer to it; and happy is he that maketh a right uſe of it. For, ſo doing, his Soul will not fall ſhort of the pure living Truth, nor ſet up any thing elſe for Truth which is not.</p>
